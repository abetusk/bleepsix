Notes
===

* Swap out back end Redis server for SQL or even file based updates
  - This should be transparent as it goes through the network
  - If it's not, separate it
* Create snapshot data format that has project information with both the schematic,
  board, libraries and whatever other information so that it's a self contained
  unit
* Create (and load) full history of project so that 'undo' can go further back
* Save all 'dead-end' paths of undo so that they still exist
  - Allow for visualization as DAG
  - Can 'prune' dead branches (based on various filters, time, etc) later
* Make a copy of module/library on a per user basis
  - Each should have it's own history
  - Updates to global library shouldn't affect boards already rendered
  - User libraries should have the option of being auto updates or not
  - Users should be able to select history libraries (and pin them, etc.)
* Kicad export/import a priority 
* Command line usage should be a priority first
  - Any web tools that use the same functions should be routed through that
    library
