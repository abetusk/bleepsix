Some notes on what to do.  2013-11-03 23:33:00
All points in each section above the '^^^...' are required before a release
can occur.

parts marked as '*' are done.

sch editor, sorted in order of (tentative) priority:


* - add GPL headers:
"Abram Connelly (c) 2013
Bleepsix v2. Release under GPLv3.

Parts based on Bleepsix v1. BSD license.
By Rama Hoetzlein and Abram Connelly"
 


* - component text (field text 0 and 1) editing
* - component text (field text 0 and 1) moving

  - load kicad schematic from local file
  - load kicad schematic from url
  - export kicad schematic

  - general undo/redo

  - login functionality

  - automatic server side saving
    . give UUID (or something) to anonymous schematic
    . give permalink
    . allow login/registration and allow schematic association 

  - search part name in the library window

  - not all pin types are rendered properly.  Render all pin types
    (clock, etc.)

  - component text editing bounding box not right when rotating (for some
    parts) (e.g. CP1 electrolytic cap in palette)

* - copying components inherets text properties (numbering?)
    UPDATE: this still needs some work.  I hacked together some stuff,
      so it's sort of working, but I suspect in not a very portable way.
      It was copying the "name" property of the component to text field 1
      and now it defaults to that if the text field doesn't have any text in
      it, otherwise it inherets the text field.  Text field 0 doesn't (used
      for auto-increment reference, so I'm not sure what to do).
      Text inhereting assumes newly created component that the
      toolComponentPlace uses is at position 0,0.

* - brooktre BT251, F0 and F1 look to be left justified in library window
    but are center justified when placing.

  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  - mouse wheel on scroll bar doesn't work

  - give dummy box around text fields for component editing when
    text field blank so it can be selected and edited

  - right click when placing wires to undo last placed wire (multiple
    right clicks to multiple undos).  Have to make sure you don't conflict
    with pan functionality (tie it to hot key?)

  - wire grab/extend operations.

             ------                     -------

    diagonal moves of joints aren't allowed


  - double click on a component to edit it's properties.  For now, that means
    editing the field 0 and field 1 properties.  In the future, provide an 
    interface to edit more general properties.  For example, add a footprint
    icon that will bring up a footprint to edit the mapping of the component
    to pcb footprint (that is, click on the footprint icon, bring up a dialog
    to pick the footprint from a list)
    For text fields which are blank, provide an empty window that the user
    can select to start putting text into.

  - allow for different options for the component palette:
    . most frequently used (default), with the standard set
      having a priority from 0 to 1 non-inclusive.
    . user settable.  Allow users to just drag library components
      into palette and not have them update otherwise.
  * . fixed (as it is now).  Provide a fixed set of components.

  - command line interface.  specifically:
    . show component/net (highlight)
    . add, remove, place parts

  - window resizing, minimizing and moving.  Might need to add decoration
    to allow for those functions.


pcb editor:

  BUG: need to record last _unconnected_ point for trace placement or
       else it might have happened to land on the track in the small
       magnet (or large magnet zone).  Pick one and be consistent.

  ISSUE: when doing pours, there is sometimes a very weak connection.
      KiCAD has a concept of minimum width, under which it doesn't
      connect.  We need to figure out how to realize this reasonably.

* - text for board and footprints
  * . text for footprints working at least...
  * . need to add hershey outline fonts so that what's displayed is as
      close a representation to the gerber produced (or whatever KiCAD
      produces) as possible

* - ratsnet lines
    . added 'shimmer'.  We might want to make this a bit nicer by doing
      a global gradient instead of just a local one.

  - pcb edges


  - GUI tools for:
    . track
    . zone
    . pcb edges
    . ruler
    . text
    (. art)

  - GUI element: layer pair display with current layer
  - GUI drop down for zone queue
  - GUI dropdowns for units and snap size

  - GUI panel for components (dockable, collapseable)
  - GUI panel for layers (dockable, collapseable)
  - GUI panel for design rules (dockable, collapsable)
    . would be nice to have them variable y height as well as x moveable

  
 

  - unassociated component parts should show up as a kind of blank box
    that the user can then click/select and associate a footprint to.

* - pad numbers displayed properly (need to handle rotations properly)
  * . pads on dips (through holes) not displaying
  * . through hole pads need to be associated with multiple layesr
  * . text for pads needs to shrink dynamically (based on size etc., maybe?)
   
* - pad obround and trapeze rendering (e.g. VALVE-ECC-83-2 (and anything else
    named ECC))
    . trapeze still not implemented, will wait till later (mvp doesn't need
      trapeze).  oblongs implemented.

* - bounding box calculations
    . for diagonals it gets tricky, need to figure out what to do. second
      level pick detection?
    DONE: bounding boxes are now calculated.  'Lines' (tracks and
      drawsegments) are treated differently and have their own picking
      functions associated with them so diagonals are taken care of 
      properly.

  - separate canvases for each of the layers so alpha can display properly

* - don't display text if you're too far away.  don't display text that's 
    out of frame.
    NOTE: might need to fiddle with the actual threshold, but infrastructure
      is there

* - footprint picking
* - trace deleting (something...simple one first, just the current line)
    . Simple deleting is working, want whole branch and eventually whole
      net deletion at some point.  Maybe for MVP not necessary?

  - net naming/splitting/joining
  * . joining named nets working.
    . joining to and from anonymous nets (netcode 0)
      = could solve this by going through and explicitely naming anonymous
        nets, keeping an anonymous net list so we don't loose information.
  * . splitting nets
      Net splits are working (might need some refactoring), but we need
      to think long and hard whether this is functionality we want.
  * . net display for boards working...not logic set up though
* - trace placement on different layers, vias, etc.
  * . sort of working ('v' while toolTrace gives vias and switches from 0 to
      15 layer).
  - give dropdown/feedback for current/linked layer
* - trace magnet pad functionality
    . still needs to be tied into net splitting/joining (and still needs to
      be tested), but this is mostly done.
    . needs to notice self intersections

  - copper pours
    . would like to have inlets for thermal traces (from pads) 
      connecting back to regions...
    . BUG: moving pours when first created goes bonkers
    . BUG: deleting pours doesn't (always?) delete the selected pour
    . want to have inset from boundary instead of extending it
    . when exporting, will need to be intelligent about how the boundary
      is made so that KiCAD will not throw DRC errors.  This might
      end up being make the czone boundaries the polyscorners...

  - drc bounds (clipper lib)
  - drc checks

  - export to KiCAD
  - export to gerber
  - export to json
  

  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  BUG: when trying to connect two nets via toolTrace, if there are no
  kinks in the trace, will not lay down.  That is, if there is a straight
  diagonal run from one net to the other with the current trace only
  having one line segment, will not lay down (issue with collisions and
  such).

  - 'esc' when laying down traces should back up one, but otherwise place it.
    

* - we'll need better bounds testing.  I think it would be sufficient to 
    create a non-axis aligned bounding rectangle and do point in triangle
    testing for the two triangles making up the rectangle.  I'm conflicted
    as to whether this should be included in the mvp or now...
    EDIT: this is essentially done.  There is a 'coarse' bounding box
      which is guaranteed to encaplsulate all of the element, including text.
      There is a 'bounding_box' which is used for picking.  Each of the
      pads in modules also contains a bounding box.  This was needed to speed
      up geometry intersectiosn when laying down traces.  It has the added
      benefit of allowing us to speed up drawing by not drawing the pads
      that are off screen.  Right now there are some flags to turn off the
      various optimizations to speed up render.  They work for the board
      layout proper, but the library modules (in the side window) aren't
      rendering properly, probably due to some checks.  We also need to
      do proper zoom level testing for the text so we don't render text that's
      too small and don't cut off text that's large.

  - export to gcode
  - export to eagle

  - some general notes on traces and nets:
    + KiCAD rips up the trace until the branch point when deleting.  I have
      found this to be pretty annoying in many cases.  I think it would be
      better to delete just the edge or take a chunk out of the line, like
      the 'erase' tool in gimp.  Users could maybe click on the trace to
      select it up until the branch and double click to select the whole
      net to delete.
    + both in the schematic and the pcb editor, connecting nets (imo) should be
      done silently and automatically, choosing one net name (maybe the lowest).
      Eagle, I believe asks everytime you want to connect a net.  KiCAD
      automatically connects nets in the schematic program but doesn't allow
      you to connect them in the pcb editor.  Connecting nets in the pcb 
      editor should be allowed and should create a rats nest connection in the
      schematic editor.  Disconnecting nets in the pcb editor should give
      an indication in the schematic editor as to the mismatched connection,
      maybe by highlighting it in red?
    + polygons need to be stored separatly from the high level information
      of nets and such.  The polygon intersections and results of the geometry
      operations will inform the high level representation, but needs to
      be kept separate in order to do computations.
      

  - silk screen (?) text is wrong on parts.  sizex and sizey determine text
    dimensional sizes, need to figure out how to render properly based on this
    information.

  - bounding box calculations are weird until we can figure out text
    width/height properties properly

  - pours with boolean operations.  For example, select a rectangle for the
    ground pour and pour.  Select an intersecting rectangle for the power
    pour with the (SRC - DST) set.  The resulting power pour will be the pour
    for the power pour with the ground pour subtracted from it.

    I'm going to try and use the clipper library (http://www.angusj.com/delphi/clipper.php)

    HA!  no need!  javascriptized clipperlib:

  - net/pin highlighting when mouse over in the schematic editor.  This
    functionality will only appear when each of the schematic editor and
    the pcb editor are open at the same time (in different windows). 
    Via communication through cookies (using BNC or the like), send a message
    to indicate which net is being mouseovered and highlight appropriately.

    keywords: inter-tab communication, cross-window messaging:

  - autoscale (with some minimum/maximum threshold) to fit first placed
    component (if no board is loaded, etc)

GENERAL:
-------

  - Abstract away the sync back to server, so that you can plug in polling (as
    an initial run) with websockets at some point without worry.  Syncing will
    poll the server for sequence numbers.  
    Getting updates from server will update local copy.  Conflicts will have
    to thought about carefully (split, highlight difference, ask user to
    confirm overwrite?).
    Updates will be sent incrementally to server.  This allows for playback
    and also undo/redo easily.
    If sequence numbers are too out of sync, we request a full flush.
    

  - visual diff (of gerbers)

  - illuminate nearby nets

  - allow for more complex modules like pre-packaged circuts that can be
    plugged into your design

  - real-time colaboration and tutorials

  - real time pricing (API to osh park or something?)



magnet pads:

1) Do an intersection test of the current tracks (two in the jointed case),
   call the resulting intersected pads/tracks i_pgns
2) Do an intersection test of the source point, call it src_pngs
3) Do an intersection test of the destination point, call it dst_pgns

4a) if |i_pgns| == 0, place the track as normal
4b) if |i_pgns| > 2, don't move the track at all
4c) if |i_pgns| == 1
  4c.a) if |src_pgns| == 0 and |dst_pgns| == 0, don't move
  4c.b) if |src_pgns| == 1 
    4a.b.a) if src_pgns is of the same net, place as normal
    4a.b.b) if src_pngs is of a different net, "shouldn't happen", don't move
  4c.c) if |dst_pgns| == 1
    4a.c.a) if dst_pgns is of the same net, **MAGNET**
    4a.c.b) if dst_pgns is of a different net, **condition magnet**

4d) if |i_pgns| == 2
  4d.a) if |src_pgns| == 1 and |dst_pgns| == 1
    4d.a.a) if src_pgns is of a different net, "shouldn't happen", don't move
    4d.a.b) (src_pgns same net) 
      4d.a.b.a) if dst_pgns is of the same, **MAGNET**
      4d.a.b.b) if dst_pgns is of a different net, **conditional magnet**
  4d.b) (|src_pgns| or |dst_pgns| 0) else dont' move (colliding middle element)


ok, let's try again

1) do an intersection test for the current tracks
2) do an intersection test for the source point 
3) do an intersection test for the destination point


CURRENT VERSION:

- lay out a virtual trace
- find all intersections for the whole trace, just the beginning point 
  and just the end point
- if there is any geometry in the middle that isn't intersecting the
  beginning and end, bail out (don't update trace)
- if there are no intersections whatsoever, just lay down/display trace
  as normal
- if there is a pad or track at the start, magnetize the source to the
  pad/track
- if there is a pad or track at the destination, 
    - if pad/track is of the same net or within some small squre
       -> 'magnetize': put the end track onto the pad/track (and return)
    - else, don't move


when sourcing from a pad/track, make sure to update the net on the trace to
be the same as the pad/track it's being sourced from

when connecting the trace to a pad/track that is of different nets, make
sure to do a net join


PCB Trace Net operations:

If an unconnected trace is placed, label with a new net name
If a trace is placed from a net, have it adopt the next
  . if destination is placed unconnected, adopts the net name
  . if destination is to an unconnected net, unconnected net adopts new net
  . if destination is to a pre-existing net, merge nets


ley down net with high (temporary) net code.  after it's layed down,
  do join/merge.
