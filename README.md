Most code is under GPLv3, with many of 3rd party libraries covered
under some equally permissive license, such as LGPL, MIT or BSD.
All code should have the license headers, so please refer to
each to determine which license is applied to which file.
All code that does not have an explicit license is implicitely
under the GPLv3.
All other non source file content not explicitely covered by a 
previously stated license is under CC-BY-SA.
